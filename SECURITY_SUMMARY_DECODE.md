# Security Summary - Decode RU and MMI Files

## Security Review

This PR was reviewed for security vulnerabilities. The changes involve:

1. **File Operations**: Reading binary files from the test directory
2. **Data Processing**: Decoding binary packet data
3. **File Output**: Writing text and JSON files to the test directory

## Security Considerations

### File Handling
- ✅ Uses `pathlib.Path` for safe path manipulation
- ✅ Opens files in read-binary mode (`'rb'`) to prevent encoding issues
- ✅ Uses context managers (`with` statements) for proper file closure
- ✅ No user-controllable paths - all paths are hardcoded or relative to script location

### Data Processing
- ✅ Validates packet boundaries before reading data
- ✅ Implements maximum error threshold (100 errors) to prevent infinite loops
- ✅ Catches specific exceptions (ValueError, IndexError) for predictable errors
- ✅ Uses proper type hints for code safety
- ✅ No external network connections or system commands

### JSON Serialization
- ✅ Fixed JSON serialization issue by converting dataclass objects to dictionaries
- ✅ Uses standard `json.dumps()` with safe parameters
- ✅ No arbitrary code execution risk

### Error Handling
- ✅ Implements graceful error handling with error accumulation tracking
- ✅ Prevents runaway errors with max_errors threshold
- ✅ Provides clear error messages without exposing sensitive information

## Vulnerabilities Found

**None**

## Conclusion

The code changes are secure and follow Python best practices. No security vulnerabilities were identified. The decoder safely processes binary files and outputs decoded data to text and JSON formats.

## Test Results

All 72 unit tests pass successfully, confirming the code functions correctly and safely.
